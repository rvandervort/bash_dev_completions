# Description

I use these scripts on a Ubuntu distro install for quickly navigating around my various repositories and projects (not all listed in the file!)

# Usage
1. source devexec as part of .bash_profile
2. copy dev to /usr/share/bash-completion/completions
3. alternatively, source dev in $HOME/.bash_completions
